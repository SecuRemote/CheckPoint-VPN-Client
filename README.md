### Additional Documentation Insights  

#### Securing a Connection to the Security Gateway  

The VPN tunnel setup process begins when a remote user attempts to access resources protected by the Security Gateway. Key phases include:  

- **IKE Negotiation**: Authenticating peer identities through methods such as digital certificates (either ICA or third-party PKI).  
- **Tunnel Establishment**: A secure VPN tunnel is created once the IKE negotiation is successful.  
- **Data Protection**: Traffic within the tunnel is encrypted using IPsec standards.  

#### Example of a Remote Access VPN Workflow  

1. Configure the Security Gateway to allow remote access VPN connections.  
2. Register remote user credentials within the Security Management Server.  
3. Define firewall policies for access control and encryption.  
4. Create LDAP or user group objects to apply firewall rules.  
5. Configure and enforce encryption settings within the VPN community object.
